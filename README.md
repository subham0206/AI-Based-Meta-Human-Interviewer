# AI-Based Meta-Human Interviewer

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an AI-powered meta-human bot capable of conducting candidate interviews. The bot analyzes verbal responses and facial expressions to evaluate candidates, generating detailed performance reports. It interacts with candidates in English via communication platforms like Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

## Steps Involved
1. **Resume Upload and Sorting**: Candidates upload resumes, which are sorted based on job profiles. The interview date and time are selected.
2. **Meta-Human Interview**: The AI bot conducts the interview at the scheduled time, interacting via voice and observing facial expressions.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: After the interview, the bot evaluates the responses, communication skills, and confidence, generating a performance report.

## Technical Expertise Required
- **Machine Learning & AI**: NLP, Computer Vision, and Speech Recognition.
- **3D Animation**: Creating and animating realistic meta-human avatars.
- **Data Engineering & Backend Development**: Managing data, APIs, and scheduling systems.
- **Integration**: Integrating with communication tools (Teams, Zoom).

## Technologies and Tools Required
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript (React.js, Node.js), C++/C#.
- **NLP**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy.
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Speech-to-Text, Amazon Polly.
- **3D Animation**: Unreal Engine, MetaHuman Creator.
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes.

## High-Level Architecture
1. **Frontend**: Portal for resume uploads and interview scheduling.
2. **Backend**: API layer for managing interactions and data storage.
3. **AI Components**: NLP, speech recognition, and facial expression analysis models.
4. **Meta-Human Avatar**: 3D animated avatar with synchronized speech and gestures.
5. **Integration**: Integration with communication platforms like Microsoft Teams or Zoom for interviews.

## Challenges
- **Speech Recognition**: Addressing diverse speech patterns and accents.
- **Realistic Animation**: Creating lifelike avatars using advanced 3D animation techniques.
- **AI Evaluation**: Multi-modal analysis combining NLP, speech, and facial recognition.
- **System Integration**: Seamless integration with existing HR systems.

## Existing AI Interview Products
1. **GreetAI**: Mock interviews with feedback on responses and facial expressions.
2. **Interview Copilot**: Provides real-time interview assistance and feedback.
3. **InterviewBot**: Simulated interviews with AI avatars for practice.
4. **MyInterview**: AI-driven evaluation of video responses and personality traits.

## Conclusion
This AI-based meta-human interviewer stands out by combining realistic avatars, real-time analysis, and detailed performance reports, offering an immersive and effective candidate evaluation process.
